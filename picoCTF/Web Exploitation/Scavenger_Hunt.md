# Solution
1. Visiting the site and viewing the html would give us part 1/4 of the flag.

2. Inspecting the css file 'mycss.css' would give us part 2/4 of the flag.

3. The next hint is given in the javascript file 'myjs.js', which refers to indexing websites. This gives an hint to web crawlers which would lead me to access the robots.txt.

5. Onto the next hint, had to look up for this one, we gotta access the DS_Store which is a common macos file which stores the attributes of its containing folder.
